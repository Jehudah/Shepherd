    subtitle: 'United in Christ, Blessed with Every Spiritual Blessing, Built Together as God\'s Temple',
    introduction: 'Ephesians is Paul\'s most comprehensive teaching on the church—its identity, unity, and mission. Written from prison, it reveals God\'s eternal plan to unite all things in Christ and calls believers to live worthy of their high calling.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Paul begins with a cascade of blessings: God chose us before creation, predestined us for adoption, redeemed us through Christ\'s blood, forgave our sins, lavished grace on us, revealed His will, gave us an inheritance, and sealed us with the Holy Spirit.',
          'All spiritual blessings are "in Christ"—our union with Christ is the foundation of everything. God "raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:6).',
          'We were dead in transgressions and sins, following the ways of the world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air. But God made us alive with Christ—"it is by grace you have been saved" (Ephesians 2:5).',
          'Salvation is "not by works, so that no one can boast." We are God\'s handiwork (Greek: poiēma, where we get "poem"), created in Christ Jesus to do good works God prepared in advance for us to do.',
          'The wall of hostility between Jews and Gentiles has been destroyed through the cross. Both are reconciled to God in one body and have access to the Father by one Spirit. Gentiles are no longer foreigners but fellow citizens with God\'s people and members of His household.'

        heading: 'The Mystery Revealed',
        paragraphs: [
          'Paul was given grace to preach to the Gentiles "the boundless riches of Christ" and to make plain the "mystery" hidden for ages: Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.',
          'Through the church, God\'s manifold wisdom is being made known to rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms. The church displays God\'s wisdom to angels and demons!',
          'Paul prays that believers would grasp how wide, long, high, and deep is Christ\'s love—a love that surpasses knowledge. May we "be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God."',
          'His doxology bursts forth: "Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!"'

          'Paul urges believers to "live a life worthy of the calling you have received"—with humility, gentleness, patience, bearing with one another in love, and making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit.',
          'There is one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all. Unity doesn\'t mean uniformity—Christ gave different gifts (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers) to equip the saints for ministry.',
          'We must "put off your old self" and "put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness." Put away falsehood, speak truthfully, don\'t sin in your anger, don\'t steal but work honestly, speak only what is helpful for building others up.',
          'Don\'t grieve the Holy Spirit. Get rid of bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander, and malice. Be kind and compassionate, forgiving each other just as Christ forgave you.',
          'Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. Children, obey your parents. Parents, don\'t exasperate your children but train them in the Lord. These relationships reflect Christ and the church.',
          'Finally, put on the full armor of God: the belt of truth, breastplate of righteousness, shoes of the gospel of peace, shield of faith, helmet of salvation, and sword of the Spirit (God\'s word). Pray in the Spirit at all times.'

    subtitle: 'Jesus Christ\'s Victory Over Evil and the Consummation of All Things',
    introduction: 'Revelation is the Bible\'s grand finale—a vision of the risen Christ, the cosmic conflict between good and evil, God\'s judgment on wickedness, and the ultimate triumph of the Lamb.

          'Revelation is apocalyptic literature—using vivid symbols, numbers, and cosmic imagery to communicate spiritual truths. It\'s also prophecy (predicting future events) and a letter (addressed to seven actual churches).',
          'The context was persecution under Roman Emperor Domitian, who demanded worship as a god. Christians who refused faced death. Revelation encourages faithful endurance by showing that Rome will fall but Christ reigns forever.',
          'Interpretive approaches vary: preterist (fulfilled in the first century), historicist (fulfilled throughout church history), futurist (to be fulfilled in the end times), and idealist (timeless spiritual truths). Elements of each may be true.'

His description is overwhelmingly glorious: hair white like wool, eyes like blazing fire, feet like bronze glowing in a furnace, voice like rushing waters, face like the sun shining in all its brilliance.',
          'In His right hand were seven stars (the angels/messengers of the seven churches), and from His mouth came a sharp double-edged sword (His word). When John saw Him, he fell at His feet as though dead.',
          'Jesus said, "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades." Jesus conquered death and holds ultimate authority.',
          'This vision shows Jesus not as a helpless baby in a manger or a suffering servant on the cross, but as the glorious, conquering King who will judge the world and reign forever.'

          'Jesus dictated letters to seven churches in Asia Minor: Ephesus (lost their first love), Smyrna (facing persecution), Pergamum (tolerating false teaching), Thyatira (tolerating immorality), Sardis (dead but thinking they\'re alive), Philadelphia (faithful despite little strength), Laodicea (lukewarm and self-deceived).',
          'Each letter follows a pattern: identification of Christ, commendation (except Laodicea), criticism (except Smyrna and Philadelphia), exhortation, promise to those who overcome, and call to hear what the Spirit says.',
          'These letters address real historical churches but also represent conditions in churches throughout history. They call for repentance, faithfulness, and endurance despite persecution or prosperity.',
          'The recurring command "to those who have ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches" shows these messages apply to all Christians everywhere.'

          'Seven bowls pour out God\'s wrath: sores on those who worshiped the beast, sea turned to blood, rivers turned to blood, scorching sun, darkness on the beast\'s kingdom, Euphrates dried up, and the greatest earthquake ever.',
          'These judgments may be sequential or overlapping perspectives on the same period. They demonstrate God\'s patient warning before final judgment and humanity\'s hardness of heart.'
